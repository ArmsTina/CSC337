        <h2>Korean Ex-Pro Player/Coach, DONGYOUNG "Arms_Tina" YANG</h2>
        <p>
            I want to introduce a Korean player I know very well. Actually, it's me!
            I was involved in Esports for about 4 years, as both an amateur and professional player, as well as a coach.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>2018 ~ 2020: Several Amateur Teams</li>
            <li>2020 ~ 2021: Pro Esports Team, SGA Incheon</li>
            <li>2022 ~ 2023: Esports Team at Western Michigan University</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            As a player, I usually took on the roles of Support and Breacher. In the first Korean Amateur League, my team won 1st place, and later, as a professional team coach, we achieved 1st place again in the Korean Pro League.
