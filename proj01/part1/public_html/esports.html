        <p>Like most FPS games, Rainbow Six Siege also has Esports. There are many types of leagues, which include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Invitational League (S-Tier League)</li>
                <li>Major League (S-Tier League)</li>
                <li>Regional League (A-Tier League)</li>
                <li>...And smaller leagues, like console leagues or collegiate leagues</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            There are 9 Regional Leagues, which have Stage 1 and Stage 2. Teams that accumulate more points from Stage 1 and 2 can earn a chance to join the Major (Global) league.
            In the Major League, there will be 24 teams from different regional leagues. The Prize Pool is $750,000.
            The Invitational League, which is the most prestigious league, is open only to the top 20 teams in the global standings.
            The Prize Pool for this league is also huge, at $3,000,000!
